Severity Estimation of Stroke Weakness Using Time-Series Analysis of Stroke Survivors' Estimated Poses Based on Video Monitoring 

The code in this repository is related to the master's thesis project.

This repository implements a novel approach for estimating the severity of stroke-induced weakness. The methodology involves processing and analyzing time-series data derived from pose estimation of stroke survivors. By leveraging advanced algorithms, this project aims to provide accurate and reliable assessments of stroke severity, facilitating better patient care and rehabilitation planning.

This project uses the MMPose framework for human pose estimation:
